package org.springframework.beans;

/**
 * Internal class that caches JavaBeans {@link java.beans.PropertyDescriptor}
 * information for a Java class. Not intended for direct use by application code.
 *
 * <p>Necessary for own caching of descriptors within the application's
 * ClassLoader, rather than rely on the JDK's system-wide BeanInfo cache
 * (in order to avoid leaks on ClassLoader shutdown).
 *
 * <p>Information is cached statically, so we don't need to create new
 * objects of this class for every JavaBean we manipulate. Hence, this class
 * implements the factory design pattern, using a private constructor and
 * a static {@link #forClass(Class)} factory method to obtain instances.
 *
 * <p>Note that for caching to work effectively, some preconditions need to be met:
 * Prefer an arrangement where the Spring jars live in the same ClassLoader as the
 * application classes, which allows for clean caching along with the application's
 * lifecycle in any case. For a web application, consider declaring a local
 * {@link org.springframework.web.util.IntrospectorCleanupListener} in {@code web.xml}
 * in case of a multi-ClassLoader layout, which will allow for effective caching as well.
 *
 * <p>In case of a non-clean ClassLoader arrangement without a cleanup listener having
 * been set up, this class will fall back to a weak-reference-based caching model that
 * recreates much-requested entries every time the garbage collector removed them. In
 * such a scenario, consider the {@link #IGNORE_BEANINFO_PROPERTY_NAME} system property.
